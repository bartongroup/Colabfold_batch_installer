# JCA_colabfold_batch

Simplified colabfold installation, derivied from [https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold](localcolabfold). The localcolabfold aproach is not really appropriate for our environment, so this is a streamlined installation.

**N.B. There are known issues involved in relaxing models using Amber on GPUs - if this fails, omit the `--use-gpu-relax` argument'. Running this part of the process on CPUs doesn't seem overly slow**
